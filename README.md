# VetClinic
Chatbots from a veterinary clinic to make an appointment for a pet. The repository has tree folders:
* DialogflowBot contains the zip with json files to restore the bot of the veterinary clinic in Dialogflow
* RasaBot contains the rasa files (python, markdown and YALM) to run the bot of the veterinary clinic with rasa
* Back-end with a Java program with a Rest API to receive Rasa, Dialogflow and FlowXO calls from the veterinary center bot and query and updates a database.
